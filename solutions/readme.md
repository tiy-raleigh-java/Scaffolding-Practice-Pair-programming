## Solutions

* Your file tree should now have a `components` folder in the `src` directory.
* In the components folder you should now have the following component files:
  - App.js
  - NavBar.js
  - Header.js
  - Section.js
  - Form.js
  - Footer.js
* The NavBar, Header, Section, Form, and Footer components should all be created and exported in their individual files.
* The App component should have a list of import statements that import all of the components from the `components` folder.
* Style sheets should all be linked and included in a `styles` folder in the `src` directory.
* The `index.html` file in the `public` directory should be copied from the starter_files and have a link for Bootstrap 4 and a class name of `container` attached to the `<div id="root">` tag.
* There should be no errors.
